# Movies App Demo
Welcome to Movies App Demo project :wave:

### What is it about?
Movies App Demo is a React app where I do experimentations (such as navigation and styling) for remote controller based devices. It works on Chrome desktop browser for now and supports HD (1280p) and FHD (1920p) resolutions. Data comes from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.

### Demo
CI automatically deploys it to Firebase when merged to master, which you can check see it up and running through https://movies-app.iepsen.com.

**Note:** For a better experience consider to add 1280p and 1920p breakpoints to Developer Tools.
